# Quick-Dish
# Our project's inspiration
One of the most important Sustainable Development Goals targets is to ensure sustainable food consumption patterns. However, there are still unsustainable food consumption patterns at the household level due to a variety of factors, one of which is a lack of cooking ideas, which has resulted in food waste at the household level.

# Project Description
The project is a progressive web application that aims to make meal preparation more convenient. The app will allow the user to search for recipes by keying in the ingredients they have on hand, and it will make recommendations on what to prepare.
